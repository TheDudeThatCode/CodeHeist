# INTRODUCTION:

+ At present, there are more than 50000
startups in India. But the biggest issue
they are facing is the lack of funding.
And due to this, they are unable to
afford a proper workspace where they
can hold meetings and discussions.
Even if they get a proper workspace
after days of searching, a lot of their
precious time is wasted in this process.

+ ### Solution: 
As developers, we plan to solve this substan-
tial issue by building a mobile application for

today's entrepreneurs to search, sort and
select a flexible workspace in restaurants
and cafes at an affordable price. Also, our
application will provide an opportunity for
restaurants and cafes to monetize their
unused area during the off-peak hours. We
will partner with most of the local restaurants

and cafes nearby. This, in turn, will help res-
taurants to generate revenue. As the startup

ecosystem matures, so do the workspaces
that startups occupy. With coworking spaces
becoming a primary choice for many new
startups, there are a number of emerging
trends in this space, especially in the Indian
market.

# Aim: ðŸ“Œ
